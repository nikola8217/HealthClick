# HealthClick

## Description

Full-stack demo application designed to support the work of clinics, medical offices, and health centers.

Initially, the application was built as a monolithic API using TypeScript (Node.js). Later, the project evolved to demonstrate proficiency in microservices architecture, Docker, and Kubernetes.

While a Vue.js frontend was also developed for the application, the primary focus of this demo is on the backend architecture and demonstrating modern development practices for scalable and maintainable systems.
